# React Mini Projects
## _This repository contains a collection of React mini projects to help you learn and practice different React concepts._

## Projects

- Complex State: Learn how to manage complex state using React's useState hook.

- Hook (useState): Explore the useState hook and how it can be used to manage state in React components.

- Keeper App: Build a simple note-taking app using React, useState, and localStorage.

- Form: Create a dynamic form with real-time input validation using React and JavaScript.

- Conditional Statement: Learn how to use conditional statements to render different UI elements based on data.

- Map, Filter, and Reduce: Practice using JavaScript's array functions to manipulate data in React components.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```sh Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-mini-projects.git
cd react-mini-projects
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server for each project separately. For example, to run the complex-state project, use the following command:

```sh
Bash
npm start complex-state
```

This will open the project in your browser at http://localhost:3000. You can then follow the instructions in each project's README file to complete the exercises.
